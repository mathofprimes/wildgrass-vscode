# Wildgrass:

Wildgrass uses just shades of green &mdash; more precisely, green is always the highest value of any color. Colors are designated as pure, gray, jade, lime, pear, drab, aqua, sage, or teal. Four darker or lighter shades of a color make up the background and foreground colors in dark or light mode, which can be set independently. Soft, medium, and hard options are also available to control contrast.
